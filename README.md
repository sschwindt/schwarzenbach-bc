## Machine learning via Bayesian optimization improves calibration of three-dimensional hydrodynamic reservoir models

This repository contains supplemental data sets for the Schwarenbach Delft3D-FLOW model, which is the baseline for the manuscript *Machine learning via Bayesian optimization improves calibration of three-dimensional hydrodynamic reservoir models* by Schwindt, Callau, Mouris, Beckers, Haun, Nowak, Wieprecht and Oladyshkin (2022).

The following files are provided:

* `meteo-bounds.csv` with meteorological data series used at the boundaries of the Deflt3D-FLOW model; notably radiation (J/m<sup>2</sup>), temperature (Â°C), relative humidity (%), and wind speed (m/s)
* `measurement-station.kml` is keyhole markup language file (e.g., for use with [GoogleEarth](https://earth.google.com/web/)) that shows the position of the measurement station in the Schwarzenbach reservoir
